# Biography

I am a physicist with a strong interest in applied sciences. My research deals with **Complex Networks**, **Data Science** and their application to social and urban systems.

I am currently a **PhD Student** at Queen Mary University of London, within the [Complex Systems and Networks Research Group](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/complex-systems-and-networks/complex-systems-and-networks-group). My supervisors are [Vito Latora](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~latora/) (QMUL) and [Elsa Arcaute](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=EARCA37) ([Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis](http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa), UCL). My main PhD project deals with the *Mathematical Modelling of Urban Systems*. I am also collaborating with the [Dynamical Systems and Statistical Physics Group](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/dynamical-systems-and-statistical-physics-group/dynamical-systems-and-statistical-physics-group) as part of the [LoBaNet](https://iaciac.github.io/lobanet/) project.

Previously, I worked at the [Institute for Scientific Interchange (ISI) Foundation](http://www.isi.it/en/home) in Turin within the [Data Science](http://www.isi.it/en/research/data-science) and [Mathematics & Foundation of Complex Systems](http://www.isi.it/en/research/mathematics-foundation-of-complex-systems) groups.

Before, I was Data Science Intern at [UN Universal Postal Union](http://www.upu.int/en.html) in Bern.
